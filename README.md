# Express

Learning express app, this repo includes some set up for express.
I've used express for http methods, on my local machine, I've used postman to check the endpoints. Currently, I've used '/users' and '/items' for getting data.
Also, env file for creating dynamic port and hostname and having log file for whenever an endpoint is fired.
